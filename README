FBWebView is a customized UIWebView. In order to use it, just add FBWebView.h/m files to your working directory. 
You can init FBWebView from any place. Just present it as a model view controller as I included UINavigationBar in the UI. 
In FBWebView there is an option to open webpage in the built-in Safari webbrowser, Sharing the link through the twitter or e-mail.

Note: Don't forget to add MessageUI and Twitter framework to get sharing work correctly.

Usage: 
    
    FBWebView *fb = [[FBWebView alloc] initWithNibName:@"FBWebView" bundle:nil];
    [fb setLink:@"http://fatih-bulut.blogspot.com"];
    [self presentModalViewController:fb animated:YES];
